        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I've always been interested in Computer Science, but have just never been sure what path to take in the field, which is why I was so glad when I discovered Treehouse.</p>
        <p>I'm currently pursuing the Front End Web Developer TechDegree, and so far, it's going great. I've learned a lot in such a short time thanks to the great instructors here. Gives me hope for what's to come!</p>
        <p>I'm also an aspiring writer, currently working on my first book. Very excited to be on this journey in Web Development and I look forward to learning more and more everyday.</p>
