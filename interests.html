        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>My interests include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I enjoy spending my free time reading novels. Adventures and Thrillers are my favorite.</li>
            <li>I sometimes write short stories. I have written at least 3 which I plan to turn into novels, but we'll see where that goes.</li>
            <li>Soft soulful music has become my new religion. I will spend hours on end listening to it. Provides much needed relaxation on specially stress-heavy days.</li>
            <li>I enjoy watching great movies too, not excluding TV shows of course. Currently can't get enough of 'Stranger Things'. That show is a living work of art and I know to appreciate good writing when I see it.</li>
